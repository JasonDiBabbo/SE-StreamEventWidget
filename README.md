# StreamElements Custom Widgets

This is a repository containing the implementations of my custom widgets for the StreamElements platform. The GitHub repo for the StreamElements index of custom widgets can be found [here](https://github.com/StreamElements/widgets) and the documentation for getting started on custom widgets can be found [here](https://github.com/StreamElements/widgets/blob/master/CustomCode.md).

# Contact 
If you want to talk about these widgets or anything about streaming, [I stream on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/monsterabe) from time to time. Additionally, there's a link to my community Discord server on my Twitch page that you can use to come chat if I'm not streaming.
